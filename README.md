# Digital Asset Registry Framework

## Overview
The Digital Asset Registry Framework is a Clarity-based blockchain solution designed to manage the registration, transfer, and authorization of digital assets. The system enables secure and flexible asset management through robust metadata handling, access control, and verification functionalities.

Key features include:
- Asset Registration with metadata (descriptor, volume, tags)
- Custodial Transfer Management
- Access Authorization & Revocation
- Classification Tagging and Updates
- Emergency Restrictions for asset management
- Verification Services for integrity and custodial validation

## Key Components
- **Asset Catalog**: Stores metadata for each registered digital asset, including descriptors, custodians, volumes, and classification tags.
- **Authorization Matrix**: Manages access permissions for third-party entities to interact with the assets.
- **Administrative Functions**: Provides the ability to apply emergency restrictions and manage asset lifecycle.

## Operations
The framework supports the following core operations:
1. **Register a new asset**: Register new digital assets with metadata, volume, and classification tags.
2. **Update asset registration**: Modify asset descriptors, volume, and tags.
3. **Cancel asset registration**: Permanently remove an asset from the registry.
4. **Transfer asset custody**: Transfer custodianship of assets to another principal.
5. **Authorize/Deauthorize third-party access**: Manage access control for third parties.
6. **Extend asset classification tags**: Add new tags to an existing asset.
7. **Emergency restrictions**: Apply restrictions to prevent asset modifications in critical situations.
8. **Asset Integrity Verification**: Ensure asset integrity and verify custodial chains.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-asset-registry-framework.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies for Clarity development.

3. Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain.

4. Interact with the contract using a Stacks-compatible wallet and frontend.

## How to Use
To register a new digital asset:
```clarity
(register-new-asset "My Asset" 1000 "Extended information" ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"])
```

To transfer asset custody:
```clarity
(transfer-asset-custody 1 <new-custodian-principal>)
```
